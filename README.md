# Active Directory Security Audit Script

## Executive Summary

This PowerShell script provides **automated security auditing** for Microsoft Active Directory environments. It identifies potential security risks, generates professional reports with visual dashboards, and helps organizations maintain compliance with security best practices.

**Key Business Value:**
- üõ°Ô∏è **Proactive Security**: Identifies vulnerabilities before they become breaches
- üìä **Executive Reporting**: Clear dashboards and metrics for leadership
- ü§ñ **Automation Ready**: Reduces manual audit time from days to minutes
- üìà **Compliance Support**: Helps meet regulatory requirements and security frameworks

---

## What It Does

The script automatically scans your Active Directory and generates comprehensive security reports identifying:

- **High-Risk Account Configurations** (weak passwords, excessive privileges)
- **Privileged User Analysis** (Domain Admins, critical groups)
- **Stale Account Detection** (inactive users that should be disabled)
- **Service Account Inventory** (special accounts requiring monitoring)

## Sample Output

## Quick Start

### 1. Basic Execution
```powershell
# Run with default settings
.\AD-Security-Audit.ps1
```

### 2. Configure Settings
Edit the `$CONFIG` section at the top of the script:
```powershell
$CONFIG = @{
    # Email settings (optional)
    SmtpServer     = "smtp.company.com"
    EmailFrom      = "security@company.com"
    EmailTo        = "admin@company.com"
    
    # Alerting thresholds
    MaxPrivilegedUsers = 10
    StaleAccountDays   = 90
    
    # Output preferences
    OutputDirectory = "C:\Reports\AD_Security"
}
```

### 3. Automated Scheduling
```powershell
# Create monthly scheduled task (run as Administrator)
New-ADAuditScheduledTask -Schedule "Monthly"
```

AD_Security_Report_20241220_1430.md
AD_Flags_20241220_1430.csv
AD_Groups_20241220_1430.csv
AD_Stale_20241220_1430.csv
AD_Audit_Log_20241220_1430.txt
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Email Notifications
Configure SMTP settings for automated report delivery:
```powershell
$CONFIG = @{
    SmtpServer = "smtp.office365.com"
    SmtpPort   = 587
    EmailFrom  = "security-reports@company.com"
    EmailTo    = "security-team@company.com;management@company.com"
    UseSSL     = $true
}
```

### Custom Thresholds
Adjust alerting levels for your environment:
```powershell
$CONFIG = @{
    MaxPrivilegedUsers = 15      # Alert if more privileged users
    MaxHighRiskFlags   = 5       # Alert if multiple risk flags
    StaleAccountDays   = 60      # Consider accounts stale after 60 days
}
```

### Analysis Options
Enable/disable specific checks:
```powershell
$CONFIG = @{
    AnalyzeStaleAccounts = $true   # Find inactive accounts
    CheckServiceAccounts = $true   # Identify service accounts
    KeepReportsForDays   = 90     # Retention policy
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Permission Denied**
- Ensure account has Domain Read permissions
- Run PowerShell as Administrator if creating scheduled tasks

**Module Not Found**
```powershell
# Install Active Directory module
Install-WindowsFeature RSAT-AD-PowerShell
# Or on Windows 10/11
Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name Rsat.ActiveDirectory.DS-LDS.Tools
```

**Charts Not Displaying**
- Verify internet connection (CDN access required)
- Try different browser
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors

**Email Reports Failing**
- Verify SMTP settings and credentials
- Check firewall/network connectivity
- Test with simple Send-MailMessage command first

---

## Security Considerations

- **Read-Only Access**: Script only requires AD read permissions
- **No Data Modification**: Script never changes AD objects
- **Sensitive Data**: Reports may contain privileged account names
- **Network Traffic**: Minimal impact on domain controllers
- **Audit Logging**: All actions logged for compliance

---

## Use Cases

### üè¢ Enterprise Security
- Monthly security posture assessments
- Compliance reporting (SOX, PCI-DSS, etc.)
- Risk management dashboards
- Incident response preparation

### üîç Security Operations
